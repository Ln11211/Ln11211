### Hi there 👋
[![@ln11211's Holopin board](https://holopin.me/ln11211)](https://holopin.io/@ln11211)
I like to train ml models 🧠🤖💥 and I love OSS as much as I love receiving 🎁s. I am a citizen scientist currently working on CERN LHC and ATLAS experiment and NASA's Cloud GAZE project in my spare time among other things :)
