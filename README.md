### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![@ln11211's Holopin board](https://holopin.me/ln11211)](https://holopin.io/@ln11211)
I like to train ml models and learn Verilog :)

Hit me up if you want to talk tech or code..

# Check out my work on 
### 1) **Image compression using Neural networks**
>**An attempt at compressing Images using Machine learning algorithms and Neural Networks. Check it out at
>[Ln11211/Image_compressor](https://github.com/Ln11211/Image_compressor)**
>
>**where I try simple algorithms such a K means cluster and some neural network arichtectures using Conv blocks and LSTM blocks to arrive at a Image compressor baselined against JPEG algorithm.**

### 2) Handwritten Digit-Classifier App
>**This fun to make, end to end project on the very infamous MNIST dataset is a great learning experience for me on deploying ML models. Do check it out at [Ln11211/Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-App](Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-App).**
>
>**It has always been my goal to deploy ML models on edge devices and I hope to make it some day.**

### 3) Neural Network projects
>These are some NN models on datasets and problems suitable for DeepLearning and Computer vision tasks. Please find the notebooks with code on loading the dataset and working on them.

### 4) Regression analysis projects
>These are some projects and kaggle notebooks on datasets suitable for regression analysis that I performed  myself. These include multiple datasets and visualisations of the data correlations and the regression fits.
