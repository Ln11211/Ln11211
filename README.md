### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![@ln11211's Holopin board](https://holopin.me/ln11211)](https://holopin.io/@ln11211)
I like to train ml models and learn Verilog :)

Hit me up if you want to talk tech or code..

# Check out my work on 

### 1) **DHaRT : DeHazing in Real Time**
>**A Deep neural network approach to dehazing in real time. Check it out at
>[Ln11211/DHaRT](https://github.com/Ln11211/DHaRT)**
>
>**DHaRT is a UNet based deep neural network architecture trained with a custom loss function to perform dehazing in real time**
---

### 2) **Sig2Sig: An OFDM fading channel estimator and equalizer**
>**An OFDM Channel estimator and equalizer based on the Pix2Pix architecture.Check it out at
>[Ln11211/Sig2Sig](https://github.com/Ln11211/Sig2Sig)**
>
>**This is a Deep learning approach to solving the fading channel estimation problem in OFDM communication system, where I train and test an image to image transaltion network and benchmark it against the LSE method**
---

### 3) **Image compression using Neural networks**
>**An attempt at compressing Images using Machine learning algorithms and Neural Networks. Check it out at
>[Ln11211/Image_compressor](https://github.com/Ln11211/Image_compressor)**
>
>**where I try simple algorithms such a K means cluster and some neural network arichtectures using Conv blocks and LSTM blocks to arrive at a Image compressor baselined against JPEG algorithm.**

### 4) Other Neural Network projects
>These are some NN models on datasets and problems suitable for DeepLearning and Computer vision tasks. Please find the notebooks with code on loading the dataset and working on them in the [neural-networks repository](https://github.com/Ln11211/neural-networks)
---

### 5) Design and Synthesis of a Stopwatch on a FPGA board (In progress)
>This is an attempt to design and synthesize the hardware circuit of a stopwatch with the funcitonality to "start", "stop", "lap" and "reset" usign Vivado design suite. I'm still working on it and I would appreciate any feedback on it [Ln11211/Stopwatch](https://github.com/Ln11211/Stopwatch)
---

### 6) Regression analysis projects
>These are a collection of projects and kaggle notebooks on datasets suitable for regression analysis that I performed  myself. These include multiple datasets and visualisations of the data correlations and the regression fits. Please find them at [Kglnotebooks](https://github.com/Ln11211/Kglnotebooks)
---

### 7) Handwritten Digit-Classifier App
>**This fun to make, end to end project on the very famous MNIST dataset is a great learning experience for me on deploying ML models that I found in the Google Developer's course. Do check it out at [Ln11211/Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-App](https://github.com/Ln11211/Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-App).**
>
>**It has always been my goal to deploy ML models on edge devices and I hope to make it some day.**
